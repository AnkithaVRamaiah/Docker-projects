To practice solving the two problems using Docker with the Dockerfile you provided, follow these simplified steps:

---

### **Problem 1: The application works on the developer's machine but fails on others due to discrepancies in environments.**

**Goal:** Create a Docker container, build the image, and push it to Docker Hub for consistent environments across machines.

#### **Step 1: Create Dockerfile**
You already have a Dockerfile on GitHub:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
CMD ["echo", "I'm learning multi-architecture builds"]
```

#### **Step 2: Build Docker Image Locally**
1. Clone your repository (if it's on GitHub):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t yourusername/multiarch-example:v1 .
   ```

#### **Step 3: Test the Docker Image Locally**
1. Run the container to ensure it works:
   ```bash
   docker run yourusername/multiarch-example:v1
   ```

   Expected output:
   ```plaintext
   I'm learning multi-architecture builds
   ```

#### **Step 4: Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**
1. Log in to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. Push the image to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker push yourusername/multiarch-example:v1
   ```

### **Problem 2: Dockerfile written on a Windows machine may cause issues on Linux due to architecture differences.**

**Goal:** Build a multi-architecture Docker image for both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures and push it to Docker Hub.

#### **Step 1: Set Up Docker Buildx for Multi-Architecture**
1. Enable Docker BuildKit:
   ```bash
   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
   ```

2. Create a new Docker buildx builder that supports multiple architectures:
   ```bash
   docker buildx create --use --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
   ```

#### **Step 2: Build Multi-Architecture Docker Image**
1. Build the multi-architecture Docker image for both `amd64` and `arm64`:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t yourusername/multiarch-example:v2 .
   ```

2. Verify the image supports both architectures:
   ```bash
   docker manifest inspect yourusername/multiarch-example:v2
   ```

#### **Step 3: Test the Multi-Architecture Image**
1. Pull the multi-architecture image on different machines or EC2 instances with different architectures:
   ```bash
   docker pull yourusername/multiarch-example:v2
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run yourusername/multiarch-example:v2
   ```

   Expected output:
   ```plaintext
   I'm learning multi-architecture builds
   ```
